Testing the Array-Based Set:
The initial set is empty.
isEmpty: returns 1; should be 1 (true)
The set contains 0 items:


Add 6 unique items to the set :
The set contains 6 items:
one two three four five six

isEmpty: returns 0; should be 0 (false)
getCurrentSize: returns 6; should be 6
Try to add another entry: add("extra")... should cause exception and did!
remove("one")... shouldn't cause exception and didn't!
Try to add a copy entry: add("six")... should cause exception and did!
contains("three"): returns 1; should be 1 (true)
contains("ten"): returns 0; should be 0 (false)
remove("one")... should cause exception and did!

The set contains 5 items:
six two three four five

After clearing the set, isEmpty: returns 1; should be 1 (true)
